## About me

Hi! You can call me Je. I've been in the QA/IT industry for a decade now, and been focusing on QA automation processes. I do engage myself to different kinds of sports such as Basketball, Volleyball, and Badminton, to name a few. I also have a passion in outdoor activities such as hiking and biking. Also love reading reading manga, science books, and tech. I make time for those activities for me to sharpen not only my body but my mind as well.
